This project focuses on the simulation of fundamental physics concepts, particularly particle dynamics and the principles of energy conservation, as described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The goal is to create a comprehensive visual representation of how particles behave in various scenarios, allowing for a deeper understanding of their interactions.

The simulation encompasses a variety of physical phenomena, including the dynamics of particle collisions, the visualization of energy transfer, and the analysis of momentum conservation. By utilizing advanced programming techniques and physics algorithms, I aim to replicate realistic particle behavior and generate insightful visualizations that illustrate the underlying principles of physics.

Throughout the project, I implemented detailed animations to demonstrate complex interactions in a clear and engaging manner. The objective is to provide an informative tool for students and enthusiasts, enhancing their grasp of essential physics concepts through interactive learning.
